🔭 **About Me:**
- 🌱 I'm a sports enthusiast with a deep love for hockey. Whether playing, watching, or analyzing, hockey is not just a game for me, it's a passion.
- 👨‍💻 When I'm not on the ice or cheering for my favorite team, I'm exploring the exciting world of technology.
- 🎯 My mission is to blend my love for sports with my tech skills to create innovative, user-friendly web applications.

🌟 **My Projects:**
- 📈 **Sports Betting App:** This isn't just another sports betting app; it's a trip down memory lane, bringing back the fun and excitement of friendly wagers made on the couch during our youth. Built with React, this app allows users to create custom bets with friends, whether it's for a cup of coffee, a treat from Tim Hortons, or other personal stakes. It's about reliving those thrilling moments of childhood bets, but now with the convenience and connection despite the distances adulthood often brings. This project is a blend of my love for sports, technology, and the nostalgia of simpler times.
- 🏒 **Hockey Sales NL:** My debut project in JavaScript, designed to help hockey fans in Newfoundland find the best deals on gear. This app simplifies the search for quality hockey equipment, ensuring you're always game-ready.
